# Template

A [Template](https://github.com/jadok/vemsy/tree/master/src/type/template.js) defined :

- template file (twig by default)
- a list of middleware

The list of middleware give you the ability to set custom middleware / variable to give to your template. Those middleware will be executed after the page middleware.
